This is the place to backup my PKGBUILDs

Dir `pingplug`: PKGBUILDs I maintained on AUR, may have a newer version than AUR ones, may be unstable.

Dir `co-maintain`: PKGBUILDs I co-maintained on AUR, may have a newer version than AUR ones, may be unstable.

Dir `others`: PKGBUILD I modified, maintained by others, may have a newer version.

I build packages with these PKGBUILDs about twice a month. I will make sure that these PKGBUILDs work on my system. But I'm not sure if these packages will work properly, or if they have the latest patches.
